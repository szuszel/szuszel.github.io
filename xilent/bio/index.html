                        There are very few producers in the world of dubstep that are as widely respected as Xilent.
                        Breaking onto the scene with the iconic “Choose Me II” in 2011 and following up with tunes like
                        “Beyond” (dubbed “Hottest Record in the World” by BBC’s Zane Lowe) and the streaming giant “Boss
                        Wave,” Xilent quickly became a household name; not just in dubstep, but in electronic music as a
                        whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a few years of experience and a few million streams under his belt, Xilent moved to put out
                        his
                        genre-bending debut album We Are Virtual in May 2015, which was met with critical acclaim (noted
                        as
                        “delicate synergism,” “a breath of fresh air” and “exceptionally vibrant” by EDM blogs). We Are
                        Virtual was a project far ahead of its time, earning him a Best Album nomination at BMA 2015,
                        while
                        intuitively blending Xilent’s unique dubstep style with elements of trance, electro and drum &
                        bass,
                        and giving listeners a coherent journey through the sonics of bass music in a manner that was
                        practically unparalleled at the time.
                    </p>

                        In the years following We Are Virtual, the Polish talent spent much of his time passing on his
                        immense production knowledge to the next generation via live streams on his Twitch channel.
                        During
                        this time, Xilent was putting out sparse –albeit very high quality– originals and remixes on
                        Disciple Recordings, UKF’s Pilot Records, Tritonal’s Enhanced Music label and SKisM’s
                        highly-coveted
                        Never Say Die Records. This time period also yielded the massive Seven Lions collaboration “The
                        Fall,” released through Skrillex’s OWSLA imprint. The positive response garnered from these
                        releases
                        prompted Zomboy to bring Xilent across North America on his Rott N’ Roll tour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Between all of this, Xilent has had massive success with his “Powerpack” sample pack series on
                        Splice. Consistently two of Splice’s most popular dubstep sample packs, Powerpack Vols. 1 & 2
                        provide up-and-coming producers with some of the secret sauce that has made Xilent stand out so
                        much
                        over the years, from ultra-punchy kicks and snares to unique stabs and glitchy bass fills.

                    <p>
                        In 2019, Xilent boldly signed on with Canada’s fastest growing record label, Monstercat. Though
                        he
                        quietly debuted on the label with the Razihel collaboration “Edge of the World” back in 2015,
                        this
                        year marked the beginning of a new alliance between Xilent and Monstercat. Gearing up to release
                        his
                        sophomore album We Are Dust, Xilent unexpectedly unleashed the 150 BPM shocker “You Rise” in
                        March,
                        followed quickly by “The Darkness.” While “You Rise” undoubtedly showed that the producer was
                        back
                        with a vengeance, “The Darkness” presented Xilent’s more euphoric side (with a switch-up that
                        alone
                        could help Xilent claim the throne of melodic dubstep). The latter also recently made its way
                        into
                        the gaming world via Rocket League Radio.

                    <p>
                        Thankfully, the party is just getting started; Xilent’s most ambitious project yet is right on
                        the
                        horizon. We Are Dust is 11 tracks of pure, unfiltered insanity, which also manage to bring
                        forward a
                        compelling narrative and completely seamless flow. Much like its predecessor, We Are Dust is a
                        perfectly refreshing project in its context, providing creative, tongue-in-cheek twists on some
                        of
                        EDM’s hottest trends; notably riddim dubstep and mid-tempo electro.

                        Though Xilent’s last couple years have been quieter than ever before, things are starting to
                        heat up
                        rapidly, and We Are Dust is only the beginning. Once and for all, Xilent is here to stay.
